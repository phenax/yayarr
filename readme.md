# yayarr (my fork of yarr)

**yarr** (yet another rss reader) is a web-based feed aggregator which can be used both
as a desktop application and a personal self-hosted server.

The app is a single binary with an embedded database (SQLite).

## usage

The latest prebuilt binaries for Linux/MacOS/Windows are available
[here](https://github.com/nkanaev/yarr/releases/latest).
The archives follow the naming convention `yarr_{OS}_{ARCH}[_gui].zip`, where:

* `OS` is the target operating system
* `ARCH` is the CPU architecture (`arm64` for AArch64, `amd64` for X86-64)
* `-gui` indicates that the binary ships with the GUI (tray icon), and is a command line application if omitted

Usage instructions:

* MacOS: place `yarr.app` in `/Applications` folder, [open the app][macos-open], click the anchor menu bar icon, select "Open".

* Windows: open `yarr.exe`, click the anchor system tray icon, select "Open".

* Linux: place `yarr` in `$HOME/.local/bin` and run [the script](etc/install-linux.sh).

For self-hosting, see `yarr -h` for auth, tls & server configuration flags.
